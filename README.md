####Background
As part of a yearly seal population survey, NOAA Fisheries collects 30,000+ aerial images of seals from fixed-wing aircraft and drones. The images are captured from direct birdseye view over beaches and rocky coasts on which seals live. Scientists pour over the images to count the number of seals, which is quite time and labor intensive.

####Goal
- Determine if CDS can take the lead on a project to develop a seal counting algorithm that can discriminate between adults and pups
- If not, determine if CDS can conduct the basic image processing to support a NOAA fisheries challenge
